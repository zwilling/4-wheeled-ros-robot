%                  collection of objects. It finds all the objects that
%                  match each pattern. The algorithm was developed for
%                  use in production system interpreters, and it has
%                  been used for systems containing from a few hundred
%                  to more than a thousand patterns and objects. This
%                  article presents the algorithm in detail. It
%                  explains the basic concepts of the algorithm, it
%                  describes pattern and object representations that
%                  are appropriate for the algorithm, and it describes
%                  the operations performed by the pattern matcher.},

%                  mapping algorithms that operate at the level of
%                  objects, rather than two- or three-dimensional
%                  occupancy. Such ~semantic maps~ permit higher-level
%                  reasoning than occupancy maps, and are useful for
%                  any application that involves dealing with objects,
%                  including grasping, change detection, and object
%                  search. We describe and experimentally verify such a
%                  system aboard a mobile robot equipped with a
%                  Microsoft Kinect RGB-D sensor. Our representation is
